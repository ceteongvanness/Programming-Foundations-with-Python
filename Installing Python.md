## 00. Installing Python
1. Navigate to the [Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-279/) that indexes downloads for the most recent versions of Python. This module was designed with Python 2 in mind so select that download.
2. Download the Windows x86 MSI installer. *If you're sure that your machine runs a 64-bit version of Windows, feel free to download the Windows x86-64 MSI installer instead*.
3. Once the download is finished, locate the file(it'll probably be in your Downloads directory) and run it. 
4. Follow the installation wizard. Let Python install to its default directory,`C:\Python27\`.

5. Ensure that both `pip` installed and that Python is added to your `PATH`.

6. To confirm that your installation was successful, open **IDLE**, a program installed by Python that makes it easy to edit and run Python code.
